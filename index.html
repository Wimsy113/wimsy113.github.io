<p>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</p>
<p><strong>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog.</strong> <em> Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son.</em> " Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.</p>

<p>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>

<li>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</li><li>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain.
